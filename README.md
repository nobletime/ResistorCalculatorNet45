# ResistorCalculatorNet45

Inspired from https://github.com/raajnadar/resistor-color-calculator

Project uses restful API to POST ColorBandValues in a JSON object to the controller "ResistorCalController.cs" and the controller returns a string that contains "resistance" and "tolerance" respectively for the Resistor. 

OhmValueCalculator.cs is under folder "Business" which does the calculation. 

Open MVCTest solution, ResistorCalculatorTest is the main project and ResistorCalculatorUnitTest project contains the unit test that tests the business logic.
